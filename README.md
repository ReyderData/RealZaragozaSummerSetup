# RealZaragozaSummerSetup
In this project I combine a little scouting and some analysis to propose options for the summer transfer window for my local team.

I created some slides to present the current situation, with a bit of background to previous years.
After that, I proceed to explain what are the positions and roles that I would reinfoce and which countries/leagues I focus on to recommend
the signings.

I sum up all of them and then I go into detail one by one with some candidates.
All the graphs are my own, created with Python and the data is provided by FBref, Fotmob, Sofascore and Transfermarkt.

This is my first time approaching a project of this kind and Every little detail and suggestion is well received.
