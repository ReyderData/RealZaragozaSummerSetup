# RealZaragozaSummerSetup
In this project I combine a little scouting and some analysis to propose options for the summer transfer window for my local team.

I created some slides to present the current situation, with a bit of background to previous years.
After that, I proceed to explain what are the positions and roles that I would reinfoce and which countries/leagues I focus on to recommend
the signings.

I sum up all of them and then I go into detail one by one with some candidates.
All the graphs are my own, created with Python and I also used Excel for some things; the data is provided by FBref, Fotmob, Sofascore and Transfermarkt.

This is my first time approaching a project of this kind and Every little detail and suggestion is well received.

I include in this project, the plot that I created earlier this year, and uploaded in this repository: https://github.com/ReyderData/week_to_week_team_analysis

For the following graphs I used data from FBRef, collected and processed with pandas and then with matplotlib to create the plots.

I will include the .ipynb file where I create them.

You can download the zip with both powwerpoint file and all images in a folder to see the project.
